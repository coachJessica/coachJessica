How much does it cost to mine bitcoin?
Mining bitcoin can be quite expensive.
Some miners pay as much as $10,000 for
their hardware, and you also need to 
factor in a high electricity bill. 

What does mining bitcoin mean?
Bitcoin mining refers to the process
of validating transactions and adding 
them to a public ledger called the 
blockchain — in other words, creating
new bitcoin.

How long does it take to mine one bitcoin?
A new bitcoin is created roughly every 10 
minutes, but keep in mind miners are
competing with all other miners,
including professionals with hundreds
or thousands of mining rigs set up 
in warehouses. The odds of an individual
miner doing so are very slim
